# Internship Task – Website Development using Bootstrap 5

## 🧠 Overview
I began by reading through the internship task instructions and outlining where each page would go. I set up a basic folder structure with main HTML files and a single CSS file.

## 🏗️ Development Process
- Included **Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)** for styling and responsiveness.
- Created a **common navbar** and **footer** for all pages.
- Built the **hero section** using the Bootstrap grid system, placing text on one side and an image on the other for a modern, balanced layout.
- Added **feature cards** and **content sections** using Bootstrap components.
- Designed the **About page** with a two-column layout to tell the business story using images and text.
- Created a **Contact page** with a Bootstrap form.
- Applied **custom CSS** for theme and typography — using a teal color scheme and the **Poppins** font for readability and a modern look.

## 💻 Responsiveness
I tested the site across different screen sizes to ensure it was fully responsive and displayed consistently on all devices.

## 🛠️ Resources Used
- [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
- **ChatGPT** (for reference and guidance)
- **Unsplash** (for free, high-quality images)

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
Some of the main issues included:
- Navbar overlapping with content  
- Image alignment and spacing problems  

I solved these using **Bootstrap utility classes** and by adjusting padding and margins.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:
- Understand the complete process of setting up and structuring a website.
- Improve my knowledge of Bootstrap components and customization.
- Learn how to maintain a uniform, clean, and responsive design.

## ⏱️ Duration
It took approximately **1 hour** to complete the entire task.
